# Basic Arduino sensor projects


## Accelerometer for inclination Sensing

Calibration and acceleration sensing using a  LIS344AL 3-axis Accelerometer. 
Implemented function to calculate inclination angles from instantaneous acceleration.


## Temperature based lighting

Calibration and analog-digital conversion of temperatures from a LM35 Texas Instruments temperature sensor. 
Display temperature values as color from a custom colormap.
